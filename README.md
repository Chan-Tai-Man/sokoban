# Sōkoban

Sōkoban clone. If I remember well, it was made in between February and March 2013 during programming classes.

To compile it, you'll have to use [FreePascal Compiler](https://www.freepascal.org/down/i386/win32.html)

## Gameplay
Sokoban is a puzzle video game in which the player pushes crates or boxes around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations.
