# Sōkoban

Sōkoban clone, or rather its prototype. You're becoming a warehouse keeper, and your goal is to push all crates to storage locations.

It was made in between February and March 2013, if I remember well, on programming classes.

To compile it, you'll have to use this: https://www.freepascal.org/down/i386/win32.html
