# Sōkoban

Sōkoban clone. If I remember well, it was made in between February and March 2013 during programming classes. It took me around 3 days.

To compile it, you'll have to use [FreePascal Compiler](https://www.freepascal.org/down/i386/win32.html)

## Gameplay
You're becoming a warehouse keeper, and your goal is to push all crates to storage locations.
